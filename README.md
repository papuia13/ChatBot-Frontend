</div>

## üöÄ Quick Start

### Prerequisites
- Node.js 18+ and npm
- Nhost account (free tier available)
- OpenRouter API key (for AI responses)
- n8n account (free tier available)

### Local Development
1. Clone the repository
2. Install dependencies: `npm install`
3. Copy `.env.example` to `.env` and fill in your credentials
4. Start the dev server: `npm run dev`
5. Open http://localhost:8080

## üìã Project Overview

Wizard AI is a modern chatbot interface that combines:

- **Frontend**: React + TypeScript + Vite
- **UI**: shadcn-ui + Tailwind CSS
- **Backend**: Nhost (Auth + Database)
- **AI**: OpenRouter API (multiple LLM models)
- **Workflow Automation**: n8n

### Key Features
- üîê User authentication & authorization
- üí¨ Real-time chat interface
- üìö Conversation history
- üé® Dark/Light mode
- ‚ö° Optimized performance

## üîê Authentication & Security

### Nhost Authentication
- User authentication is handled by Nhost's built-in auth system
- Supports email/password, social logins (Google, GitHub, etc.), and passwordless login
- Email verification is required for new signups
- JWT tokens are automatically managed by the Nhost client

### Hasura Permissions
- Row-Level Security (RLS) is configured for all tables
- Users can only access their own data through permission rules:
  ```sql
  -- Example permission for messages table
  CREATE POLICY "Users can view their own messages"
  ON messages FOR SELECT
  USING (auth.uid() = user_id);
  ```
- All GraphQL operations are protected by JWT verification
- Custom actions (like `sendMessage`) include permission checks

### Session Management
- Sessions are managed by Nhost
- JWT tokens are stored in HTTP-only cookies for security
- Automatic token refresh is handled by the Nhost client

## üõ†Ô∏è Complete Setup Guide

### 1. Nhost Setup
1. Sign up at [Nhost](https://nhost.io/)
2. Create a new project
3. Note your project's subdomain and region
4. Enable Authentication and Database services

### 2. Database Configuration
1. Open Hasura Console from Nhost dashboard
2. Create required tables with these SQL commands:

```sql
-- Create chats table
CREATE TABLE public.chats (
  id uuid DEFAULT gen_random_uuid() PRIMARY KEY,
  user_id uuid REFERENCES auth.users(id) NOT NULL,
  title text NOT NULL,
  created_at timestamptz DEFAULT now()
);

-- Create messages table
CREATE TABLE public.messages (
  id uuid DEFAULT gen_random_uuid() PRIMARY KEY,
  chat_id uuid REFERENCES public.chats(id) ON DELETE CASCADE NOT NULL,
  role text NOT NULL CHECK (role IN ('user', 'assistant')),
  content text NOT NULL,
  created_at timestamptz DEFAULT now()
);

-- Enable Row Level Security
ALTER TABLE public.chats ENABLE ROW LEVEL SECURITY;
ALTER TABLE public.messages ENABLE ROW LEVEL SECURITY;

-- Set up permissions
CREATE POLICY "Users can view their own chats" 
ON public.chats FOR SELECT 
USING (auth.uid() = user_id);

CREATE POLICY "Users can insert their own chats"
ON public.chats FOR INSERT
WITH CHECK (auth.uid() = user_id);

-- Similar policies for messages table
CREATE POLICY "Users can view their own messages"
ON public.messages FOR SELECT
USING (EXISTS (
  SELECT 1 FROM public.chats 
  WHERE public.chats.id = public.messages.chat_id 
  AND public.chats.user_id = auth.uid()
));


### 3. Create Action for Sending Messages
1. In Hasura, go to "Actions" tab
2. Create a new action named `sendMessage` with handler URL from n8n (see next section)
3. Define input type:
   ```graphql
   chat_id: uuid!
   content: String!
   role: String!
   ```
4. Define output type: `message: messages`
5. Configure webhook handler and forward client headers

### 4. n8n Workflow Setup

#### Option 1: Import Pre-configured Workflow
1. In n8n, click on the "Workflows" menu
2. Click the "+ New" button and select "Import from File"
3. Select the file `docs/n8n-workflow-export.json` from this repository
4. After importing, update the following values in the workflow:
   - In the "Hasura: Fetch History" node, set your Nhost Hasura URL
   - In the "OpenRouter: Chat Completions" node:
     - Update `YOUR_OPENROUTER_API_KEY` with your actual OpenRouter API key
     - Set `YOUR_SITE_URL` to your application's URL
     - Update `Your App Name` to your application's name

#### Option 2: Manual Setup
1. Create a new workflow in n8n
2. Add a Webhook node and configure it to receive POST requests
3. Add a Function node to process the incoming message
4. Add an HTTP Request node to call OpenRouter API
   - Method: POST
   - URL: `https://openrouter.ai/api/v1/chat/completions`
   - Headers:
     - `Authorization: Bearer YOUR_OPENROUTER_API_KEY`
     - `HTTP-Referer: YOUR_SITE_URL`
     - `X-Title: YOUR_APP_NAME`
5. Add a Response node to send back the AI response

For detailed node configurations, refer to the exported workflow in `docs/n8n-workflow-export.json`

### 5. Environment Setup
Create a `.env` file in the root directory with:
```
VITE_NHOST_SUBDOMAIN=your-nhost-subdomain
VITE_NHOST_REGION=your-nhost-region
VITE_OPENROUTER_API_KEY=your-openrouter-key
VITE_N8N_WEBHOOK_URL=your-n8n-webhook-url
```

### 6. Running the Application
1. Install dependencies:
   ```bash
   npm install
   ```
2. Start the development server:
   ```bash
   npm run dev
   ```
3. Access the app at `http://localhost:8080`
4. The app will handle user authentication automatically through Nhost
